                    <h4>vision</h4>
                    <p>Vision is the process by which the eyes and brain work <br>
                        together to perceive the environment. Light enters the <br>
                        eye through the cornea, passes through the lens, and is <br>
                        focused onto the retina at the back of the eye. The retina <br>
                        contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that convert <br>
                        light into electrical signals. These signals are transmitted <br>
                        via the optic nerve to the brain, where they are processed to <br>
                        form images. Vision involves not only the detection of light <br>
                        but also the interpretation of shapes, colors, movement, and <br>
                        depth, allowing us to understand and interact world around us</p>

                    <h4>goals</h4>
                    <p>Goals are desired outcomes or targets that <br>
                        individuals or organizations aim to achieve. <br>
                        They provide direction, motivation, and a measure <br>
                        of progress. Goals can be short-term or long-term <br>
                        and are often specific, measurable, achievable, <br>
                        relevant, and time-bound (SMART).<br>
                        Short-term goals: Achievable in a near timeframe <br>
                        Long-term goals: Require extended time and planning <br>
                        Personal goals: Learning a new skill, improving health, saving money.<br>
                        Career advancement, completing a project, increasing sales.<br>
